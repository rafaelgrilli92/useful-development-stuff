- **Lodash - Memoize:** [[https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#memoize](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#memoize)]: Used to avoid doing a request with the exact same parameters. It stores the result in cache and if it receives the exact same parameters, it will return the cached result.

- **Lodash - Uniq, UniqBy, UniqWith:** [[https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#uniq](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#uniq)]: Creates a new array with unic values and can be used with objects as well.
- **Lodash - Map:** [[https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#map](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#map)]: Same as Array.map but with many additional features.
- **Lodash - Chain:** [[https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#chain](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#chain)]: Can be used to call as many functions as you want in a chain instead of creating many variables to store data to use in subsequent functions.
